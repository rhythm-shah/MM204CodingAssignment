# MM204CodingAssignment

Coding Assignment - MM 204 - 190110053, 190110054, 190110074

Assignment is coded in MATLAB a programming language and numerical computing environment developed by MathWorks.

To run the code,

Enter the directory where the code - "MM204_ProgrammingAssignment.m" is saved/uploaded.

And in the COMMAND WINDOW type the following - "MM204_ProgrammingAssignment".
This runs the code and prompts the user to type in the number of nodes.

Simply put in the number of nodes and the code will calculate the temperatures at different times on different nodes, in a matrix named "Tf".

The first column of the matrix represents temperatures at different time on node one.

Similarly for the second column represents temperatures at different time on node two and so on.

The first row of the matrix represents temperatures at t = 0 on different nodes.

Similarly for the second row represents temperatures at t = delta-t on different nodes and so on.

Using the number of nodes we calculate delta-x. And using the condition on coefficients of temperature values we get delta-t.
Using the value of delta-t we determine the number and size of steps the code will take on each iteration
